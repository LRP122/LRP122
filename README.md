ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LRP122

I am a physicist and developer, having fun coding, solving problems, and learning new technologies.

I code mostly in Python and have experience in cloud technologies (AWS, Azure) and deploying this using IaC.
I am also passionate about energy, the grid, and everything energy transition-related.
