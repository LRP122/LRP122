ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LRP122

I am a physicist and developer, having fun coding, solving problems, and learning new about new technologies.

I code mostly in C++ and Python and have experience in cloud technologies (AWS, Azure) and deploying this using IaC.
I am also passionate about energy, the grid, and everything energy transition-related.

Currently working a lot on embedded and Arduino projects and learning Rust to create safer code.
